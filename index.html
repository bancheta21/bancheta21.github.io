    <h1>Ben Ancheta</h1>
    <p><em>Bachelor of Computer Science and Business Administration (Finance) at Northeastern University</em></p>
    <p>I am a second year student at Northeastern. Some of my previous projects include a chess game, more projects to be determined lol.
      In the future, I hope to learn more about practical applications of Artificial Intelligence.
      Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
