    <h1>My name is <strong>Ben Ancheta</strong></h1>
    <p>I am a 3rd year computer science major from Honolulu, Hawaii. Throughout my co-op experiences I have 
      worked at MFS investment management doing data science, and at Google doing software engineering. 
      Next summer I will be trying something new (consulting) in Los Angeles at BCG which I am very excited 
      about! Some of my hobbies include surfing, hiking, weighlifting, and anime.</p>
      <p>In the future, I want to include more content about myself (more fun pictures, etc.). I also want 
        to make this kind of a blog where I post some of my thoughts on philosophical/moral issues. Ideally, 
        this website will be a place that I update every so often and am able to look back at all the fun I've 
        had over the years.</p>
