        <h1>Introduction to the Interview Project</h1>
        <p>
          The interview project involved finding a professional in our chosen
          field (in my case Software Engineering). During this interview, I
          learned about how to use writing to my advantage in my future career,
          and learned some key elements to writing successfully in the
          workplace.
        </p>

        <h1>Interview Details</h1>
        <p>
          Interviewer: Ben Ancheta <br />
          Interviewee: Haleluya (Hal) Asfaw
          <br />
          Date: 2/10/2024
          <br />Place: Washington DC
        </p>
        <p>
          For my interview project, I had the pleasure interviewing Haleluya
          Asfaw, a software engineer working at Etsy in Washington DC. While
          visiting DC, I met Hal for lunch and talked to her about her
          experience with writing in the workplace, focusing on her experience
          as a newly hired software engineer. Her experience as a newly hired
          software engineer will be especially helpful to individuals who are
          considering software engineering as a career, as it contains useful
          tips that can be implemented now in order to improve one’s writing in
          the workplace.
        </p>
        <h1>Key Points</h1>
        <h2>Writing in the Workplace</h2>
        <p>
          As a new software engineer, Hal’s main encounters with writing are
          "writing project docs, explaining how the tickets [she] worked on were
          completed, and sending emails for communication to other teammates."
          Hal shared her thoughts on the importance of writing in the workplace
          by saying that every engineer is a talented programmer, but what truly
          sets someone apart and makes upper level management want to promote
          them is their communication abilities, which are commonly evidenced by
          writing as writing is more accessible to evaluate than spoken
          communication. Hal was promoted to a second-level engineer in six
          months when a usual new hire on average takes over a year to make this
          jump. Hal cited most of her success to the fact that she is very
          capable at representing her work in a good light through writing.
        </p>
        <h2>Formal Education’s Impact on Writing in the Workplace</h2>
        <p>
          Most of Hal’s formal English education was not very applicable in the
          workplace, other than helping her know how to construct sentences.
          However, she said that her Advanced Writing class, which she took in
          her Junior year at Northeastern helped her a lot with communicating
          effectively through writing. Through her advanced writing class, she
          learned the skills of writing with concise emails that are clear and
          get the point across.
        </p>
        <h2>Collaborative Writing</h2>
        <p>
          Hal and I took some time to discuss how collaborative writing is
          facilitated in the workplace. At Etsy, they use Google Docs to write
          technical documentation, and use BitBucket as a code repository. As
          most software engineers know, using technologies such as BitBucket for
          collaborative writing can be challenging due to merge conflicts, so
          Etsy employees generally use Google Docs to proofread the writing so
          other engineers can leave comments and feedback, and only push the
          technical documentation to BitBucket once it is completed.
        </p>
        <h2>Taking a reader’s perspective</h2>
        <p>
          I asked the question "what is the greatest thing that one can do to
          improve their writing?". Hal's simple reply was to “take a reader’s
          perspective”. As a new hire learning the technology stack of Etsy,
          along with having to learn her way around a large codebase, looking at
          project specifications and code that were well-written was extremely
          helpful when compared to documents and code that were not
          well-written. She said that the best way to proofread writing is to
          "take the perspective of someone who is busy and doesn’t know exactly
          what you’re talking about", so that you can make sure you cover all
          potential gaps in knowledge properly while also making sure that you
          get your point across in as few words as possible.
        </p>
        <h1>Changes I will implement in my writing</h1>
        <p>
          Going forward, I will definitely attempt to take more of a reader's
          perspective when proofreading my writing in order to identify any
          assumptions that I might have about the reader's knowledge. An
          assumption that a recipient knows more than they do creates a gap in
          knowledge, which requires an additional follow-up and makes
          communication less efficient and takes more time. This is very
          important, as when trying to communicate with someone else who has
          limited time (and all people have limited time), it's important to
          minimize back and forth by including all essential information in the
          initial communication. <br />Additionally, I will continue to work on
          my collaborative writing, as writing in the workplace is often
          collaborative. I plan to do this by working on new software projects,
          and instead of only focusing on creating functional code, also
          focusing on writing good READMEs and commenting code so that others
          are able to easily understand the projects that I am working on.
          Finally, on my next project, I will attempt to write end-user
          documentation to test using the how-to guide I wrote.
