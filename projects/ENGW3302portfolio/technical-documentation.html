        <h1>Introduction to the Technical Documentation Project</h1>
        <p>
          For the technical documentation assignment, we were tasked with
          breaking down a technical document of our choice, and using this
          document to construct a how-to guide of how to write a similar
          document. Check out how to write concise, understandable, and engaging
          end-user documentation here!

        <h1>How to Write End-User Documentation</h1>
        <p>
          A Pathway to Readable and Engaging End-User Documentation <br />
          Ben Ancheta
        </p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          As a software engineer building a product, you may be required to
          write end-user documentation in order to make your product usable by
          end-users. It can be very difficult to distill technical concepts into
          guides for new end-users to understand; however, end-user
          documentation has many benefits such as helping end-users understand
          how to install and set up a product, along with troubleshooting common
          issues [1]. Well-written end-user documentation can avoid large
          quantities of support tickets from users struggling to use basic
          features of the product, and can help to prevent unethical use of the
          product if the proper usage is specified in the documentation [2,3].
        </p>
        <h1>Initial Considerations</h1>
        <p>
          Before starting to write end-user documentation, it’s important to
          keep the user’s perspective in mind to ensure that the documentation
          is effective and helpful. Keeping the user’s perspective in mind
          involves understanding their technical skills, familiarity with the
          product or service, and understanding what they wish to achieve by
          using your product’s documentation. Tailoring the content of your
          end-user documentation to match the user’s expertise and expectations
          is crucial.
          <br />
          The desired structure of the documentation is also significant. A
          commonly used structure is described in the next section.
        </p>
        <h1 id="potential-structure">Potential Structure</h1>
        <p>
          Below is an example of a potential end-user documentation structure
          that can apply to most kinds of products. The optional sections are
          highly recommended as they can improve the efficacy of your
          documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./graphic.png" width="300" />
          <br />This image displays a graphic detailing a potential structure of
          end-user documentation.
        </p>
        <h1 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h1>
        <p>
          A table of contents can improve the usability and effectiveness of any
          document. It improves the ease of navigation by enabling users to
          quickly find the needed information without having to read through
          irrelevant sections and gives an overview of the topics covered in the
          documentation which increases the confidence of users that the
          documentation will be able to get them set up and using the product
          properly. A detailed table of contents can also increase the perceived
          professionalism of the documentation, making users more likely to use
          it.
          <br />
          An example table of contents is on the left of this text. The table of
          contents should be “sticky”, which means that it moves as the reader
          scrolls so that ease of navigation is improved.
        </p>
        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          The introduction section provides a general overview of the product,
          and details the hardware requirements to run the software product.
          This section should be engaging and detail key functionalities of the
          software product that will entice the user and make them interested in
          the product, and thus in reading the documentation to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./intro.png" width="1000" />
          <br />This image displays an example introduction section.
        </p>
        <h1 id="feature-documentation">Feature Documentation</h1>
        <p>
          This section is generally seen as the most important section in
          end-user documentation, because it contains the information that most
          users who visit the documentation are trying to find. This section
          varies the most between different products’ end-user documentation,
          because every product’s features are different. When reading different
          products’ end-user documentation, one might become overwhelmed because
          the features are completely different. However, there is no need for
          confusion; clear and engaging feature documentation uses key concepts
          that can be applied across any type of feature, whether it be an API
          (requires programming knowledge to use), full-stack application, or
          even a web application. These key concepts are using boxes to
          highlight important concepts, using bolding to emphasize specific
          words, and using a uniform color scheme. Additionally, writers of
          documentation should attempt to keep paragraphs between two and four
          sentences in order to avoid overwhelming end-users.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./feature.png" width="1000" />
          <br />This image displays an example feature documentation section.
        </p>
        <h1 id="tutorials">Tutorials [Optional, but recommended]</h1>
        <p>
          Tutorials are a purely optional section to include in end-user
          documentation; however, tutorials are unmatched in their ability to
          engage and teach the end-user about your product. Tutorials should be
          engaging and beginner-friendly to ensure that all potential users are
          able to follow the tutorial and gain experience with your product.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./tutorial.png" width="1000" />
          <br />This image displays an example tutorial section.
        </p>
        <h1 id="best-practices">Best Practices [Optional, but recommended]</h1>
        <p>
          The best practices section can help users understand the most
          efficient way to use your product. This section can also help to
          encourage users to follow the proper steps in order to minimize the
          occurrences of negative outcomes such as data loss. <br />Best
          practice sections can also highlight advanced features that might not
          be able to be explained in the very detailed features section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="./best practices.png" width="1000" />
          <br />This image displays an example best practices section.
        </p>
        <h1 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h1>
        <p>
          Color Scheme: The color scheme of the document is important to
          consider. For example, younger audiences might prefer dark themes
          versus older audiences might prefer more traditional styles with a
          white background and black text.
          <br />
          Tone: The tone of the document is also important to consider. Younger
          audiences might prefer a more engaging tone that draws their
          attention, meanwhile older audiences might prefer a more formal tone.
        </p>
        <h1 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h1>
        <p>
          End-user documentation is an essential feature when releasing software
          to any audience of end-users. Knowing how to write good end-user
          documentation can be the difference between having mountains of
          support tickets or even keeping customers happy and using your
          product.
          <br />Additionally, having the ability to write functional end-user
          documentation is a soft-skill that will set you apart from your
          colleagues and could help you advance faster in your career as a
          result.

        <h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>
        <p>
          I would like to thank my ENGW 3302 peers, Ailton (AJ) Teixeira and
          Madison O'neil, along with my instructor, Alison Stephens, for their
          feedback during the review period, which has been critical in bringing
          this how-to document from conception to completion. More thanks goes
          to Discord’s great and interactive end-user documentation, which is
          very comprehensive and shows good examples of many of the concepts
          that I outline in this how-to document. <br />A huge thank you overall
          to my friends and family; I wouldn’t be who I am today without all of
          you.
