      <h1>Introduction to the Statement on AI-Assisted Writing</h1>
      <p>
        The AI-Assisted writing assignment had us construct an opinion on the
        use of AI-writing tools in our varying technical fields. I initially
        talk about my thoughts on AI-Writing tools as a whole, then their impact
        on writing for software engineers.
      </p>
      <h1>Statement on AI-Assisted Writing</h1>
      <p>
        AI writing tools have made quick strides in recent times as tools like
        ChatGPT are now able to create text that reads very similarly to genuine
        authors. Other web applications such as Elicit are able to help
        researchers find published papers to aid in research. AI writing tools,
        when used properly, can improve the clarity, cohesion, and concision of
        writing. However, AI writing tools can also cause the propagation of
        false information, which can compromise what these tools were built to
        do, which is increasing the spread of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        After discussing AI writing tools in class, I realized that these
        resources can be very useful in helping to improve clarity and find
        grammatical errors in writing. In my writing for this class, I used AI
        writing tools to find sources (Elicit) and to proofread passages
        (ChatGPT).
      </p>
      <p>
        Using AI writing tools to fully compose a document, whether it be
        technical or fiction, at the end of the day feels dishonest to me.
        Writing is a medium used to communicate from person to person, and using
        AI tools without much human input feels impersonal. As models such as
        GPT write in the same style, they remove each authorâ€™s stylistic input
        into writing. Using AI to completely complete any task, whether it be
        professional or personal, takes away from the authentic communication
        that is writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I believe that AI writing tools can help us realize the
        mistakes that we might make in our work, and can aid in ensuring that
        our writing is clear to the audience. However, they should not be
        completely composing pieces or writing because that takes away the human
        element of writing that creates diversity and differing opinions.
