        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a collection of writing that I have done for my
          ENGW3302 class: Advanced Writing in the Technical Disciplines.
          Throughout this course, we worked on a few key projects:

        <p>
          Growing up, I didn’t have any experience or interest in computer
          science; however, after taking a computer science elective by chance
          in my first semester of freshman year, I immediately added computer
          science to my business administration major. I’ve done co-ops at MFS
          and Google in software engineering, and this summer I’ll be interning
          in Los Angeles as a management consulting intern at Boston Consulting
          Group.

          I was raised in Hawaii, so participating in any outdoor activity is
          always fun and relaxing to me. Some of my favorite ways to spend time
          include surfing, reading, hiking, and watching anime with my friends.
