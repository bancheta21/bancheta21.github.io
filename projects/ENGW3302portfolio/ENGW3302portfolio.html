        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a collection of writing that I have done for my
          ENGW3302 class: Advanced Writing in the Technical Disciplines.
          Throughout this course, we worked on a few key projects:
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, I didn’t have any experience or interest in computer
          science; however, after taking a computer science elective by chance
          in my first semester of freshman year, I immediately added computer
          science to my business administration major. I’ve done co-ops at MFS
          and Google in software engineering, and this summer I’ll be interning
          in Los Angeles as a management consulting intern at Boston Consulting
          Group.

          I was raised in Hawaii, so participating in any outdoor activity is
          always fun and relaxing to me. Some of my favorite ways to spend time
          include surfing, reading, hiking, and watching anime with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          TURN THESE INTO HYPERLINKS!! The AI-Assisted writing assignment had us
          construct an opinion on the use of AI-writing tools in our varying
          technical fields. I initially talk about my thoughts on AI-Writing
          tools as a whole, then their impact on writing for software engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the technical documentation assignment, we were tasked with
          breaking down a technical document of our choice, and using this
          document to construct a how-to guide of how to write a similar
          document. Check out how to write concise, understandable, and engaging
          end-user documentation here!
        </p>
        <p>
          The interview project involved finding a professional in our chosen
          field (in my case it was Software Engineering). During this interview,
          I learned about how to use writing to my advantage in my future
          career, and learned some key elements to writing successfully in the
          workplace.

          The literature review is a document that takes different research
          papers and puts them in conversation with each other, in order to
          answer a research question. This project taught me how to critically
          find sources, analyze them, and then draw conclusions based on what I
          had read.
