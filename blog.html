  <h2>What Made me Love Programming (Again)</h2>
  <p>
    This post is mainly just made to remind myself why I enjoy coding. Recently
    (late 2022/2023), I have been super unmotivated to pursue any sort of
    software project. The root cause of this issue is due to the fact that I
    view learning new technologies as a chore.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, what I have come to realize (again), and I'm sure I'll continue to
    re-realize in the future is that learning new technologies is truly an
    enjoyable experience. Whether it is learning how to express your ideas in a
    new way I couldn't before or learning a more efficient way to make something
    work, it is thrilling to be able to bring my ideas/optimizations to reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope I don't slip into another deep pool of unmotivation, however, if I
    do, I will read this post and hopefully remember why I fell in love with
    computer science in the first place.

  <h2>My Goals for 2023 (Programming and Not)</h2>
  <p>
    This post is to remind myself of my goals and why I am pursuing them. The
    things that bring me fulfillment are spending time with people I care about
    and helping others. Therefore, my goals should be bring me to a point where
    I am able to be fulfilled at all times.
  </p>
  <p>
    My overarching goals are to be financially independent and to be healthy. To
    offer an explanation for these goals , although it might not be necessary, I
    want to be financially independent so that I have no restrictions on when/
    where I am able to spend time with friends and family. In regards to being
    healthy, I generally love living life and I'd like to stick around as long
    as possible, given there is no guarantee of an afterlife (controversial
    opinion, I know).
  </p>
  <p>
    After all that explanation, this finally leads to my goals for this year.
    Originally, my two goals were to weigh 185 lbs and to have a net worth of
    $100k. The net worth goal of $100k still stands, especially since I am going
    to be finishing up my co-op then continuing on to my Google internship. In
    order to accomplish this goal, I am spending under $30/day on average. I
    track this through a Google spreadsheet.
  </p>
  <p>
    In regards to the goal of weighting 185 lbs, I think I'll scrap it. I only
    wanted to achieve this goal because throughout the course of my life I have
    been seen as very skinny (150 lbs at 6'2" doesn't look great). However, I am
    deciding to rework this goal since it doesn't work towards my overarching
    goals. Of course, I will continue to go to the gym in the mornings before
    work; my focus just won't be on gaining weight. By the end of this year, I
    want to maintain my current weight while also being able to run a marathon.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reiterate, my final goals for 2023 are to end the year with a new worth
    of $100k and to be able to run a marathon while maintaining my current
    weight (~170 lbs).
  </p>
  <p>
    Tech wise, I won't set any specific goals since I want to continue enjoying
    programming and learning new technologies and it's important to me to not
    burn myself out this early, especially if I will be pursuing this career
    path for the next 10-40 years. I at least hope to have a personal website I
    am proud of by the end of the year and to finish the chess game that I am
    currently working on.

  <h2>Book Review: The Paper Menagerie</h2>
  <p>
    <em>The Paper Menagerie</em> by Ken Liu is definitely the best book I've
    read recently, and one of the best I have read in my life in general. The
    book itself is a collection of short stories, with my personal favorite
    being one which shares a name with the book. The story evoked intense
    feelings of wanting to spend more time with the people I hold close to my
    heart and to not take them for granted. It perfectly illustrated how I felt
    during my early teen years as I attempted to push away the people I loved
    even though all they wanted was for me to be the best that I could.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The Paper Menagerie</em> is certainly a book/short story that I will
    read many times throughout my life, as it has a great message of not taking
    what you love for granted and appreciating the people around you as there is
    no guarantee that they will be around forever.
  </p>
